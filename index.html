<h3>Dib(french) entertainer Michel Lotito holds the Guinness World Record for the “strangest diet” – an extremely fitting record for him. In his lifetime, Lotito consumed 18 bicycles, 15 supermarket trolleys, seven television sets, six chandeliers, two beds, a pair of skis, a Cessna 150 aircraft, a computer, and an entire coffin – handles and all.

For his strange diet, Guinness World Records awarded him a brass plaque, which he, of course, ate. By 1997, Lotito had eaten nearly nine tons of metal. He was able to consume these typically indigestible objects because he had an extremely thick lining in his stomach and intestines, which allowed him to consume sharp metal objects without injury. However, this also meant that soft foods made him feel sick. Lotito passed away in 2007 from natural causes.</h3>
